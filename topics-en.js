                    <p>Water is very important. It makes up about 60% of our body weight. However, drinking too much water can be dangerous. This happens because our <strong>kidneys</strong> can only process about 1 liter of water per hour.</p>
                    <p>If we drink too fast, the water stays in the <strong>bloodstream</strong> and makes the <strong>sodium</strong> (salt) too low. Then, the water moves into our <strong>cells</strong>, making them <strong>swell</strong> like a balloon.</p>
                    <p>This is very bad for the brain because the <strong>skull</strong> is hard and cannot expand. This pressure can cause headaches or make you feel <strong>confused</strong>. To be safe, you should only drink when you are <strong>thirsty</strong>.</p>
